# StoryListener 

Story Listener is an application build in **swiftUI** to write the stories **without** typing anywhere . You can start writing by just speaking and it will **listen** to you 
and will add the story to the story lists . 

To save the stories in local , I used **Core Data** (apples framework) . You can delete the stories and **persist** the story in local . 

**AVFoundation** : A Framework use to handle the sound and voice in swift<br />
**Speech** : A Framework to handle the speech recognition in swift <br />
**Core** **Data** : A Framework to persist the data in local <br />
